# DailyPlanner

#This project consists of a simple daily planner from 9AM to 5AM. It displays the current day at the top of the page and throughout the day text blocks change color to indicate if that timeblock has passed, is current, or is upcoming. There is also a feature to save text when plans are being made, which stay when the screen is refreshed.
